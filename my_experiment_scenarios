Tools:
iperf3 
.json
ss -tin
tcpdump

Metrics:
throughput, goodput, rtt, jitter, retransmission, rto, packet loss, cwnd, sending rate elapsed time, queue buffere 

FILE format :

ss tin log  - in each client and server 
.json  - in each client and server 
.pacap - server 


conditions :

upload and download 

scenarios (only 2 flows at a time) :

Cubic vs BBRv1, Cubic vs BBRv2,Cubic vs BBRv3 (both upload and download  starting at the same time and ending exactly at the same time )

Cubic vs BBRv1, Cubic vs BBRv2,Cubic vs BBRv3 ( both upload and download cubic start first and BBR of all versions start 15 seconds later)
Cubic vs BBRv1, Cubic vs BBRv2,Cubic vs BBRv3 ( both upload and download  BBR of all versions start first and cubic start 15 seconds later)

scenarios of similar CCAs:

cubic vs cubic (starting at same time )
cubic vs cubic (staggered at 15 s )
bbrv1 vs bbrv1 (starting at same time )
bbrv1 vs bbrv1 (staggered at 15 s )
bbrv2 vs BBRv2_(starting at same time )
BBRv2 vs BBRv2 (staggered at 15 s )
BBRv3 vs BBRv3( starting at same time )
BBRv3 vs BBRv3   (staggered at 15 s )


Iperf3 parameters:
t = 120 
i = 1
timesteps 
-C flag for congestion contorl algorithms
_- R flag for download 
- J for .json
ss tin 
Ip address 
port 


NOte : save all metrics in .json file long and ss -tin log of both clients and server sides and pcap file in server side 

use ssh

pull all saved files in host laptop from all ubuntu laptop of server and  clients 

Also confirm cca with sysctl ipv4...
